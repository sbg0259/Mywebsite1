    "text": "Title: Using R to Redesign Statistical Graphs: Application to Flight and Spotify Datasets\nEffective data visualization is crucial for clearly and successfully expressing ideas in the field of statistical research. In our first STAT 515 mid-project, we used R programming to restyle graphs for two different datasets: Flights and Spotify. Notably, we revised the graphics showing the distribution of airtime and the average delay by month for the Flights dataset and converted the time data into a more understandable format. In a similar vein, we redesigned the Spotify dataset’s popularity numbers and top 10 genres presentation. By making these efforts, we want to improve the graphical representations’ readability and aesthetic appeal and enable more in-depth understanding of the underlying data trends.\nOne of the most effective methods for identifying patterns and trends in datasets is statistical visualization. In order to improve readability and clarity, we redesigned the Flights and Spotify dataset graphs using R programming for our project. Our goal was to give better insights into these statistics by revamping graphs for important metrics including delay, airtime distribution, popularity, and genre distribution, as well as altering the way time data is represented.\nFor data manipulation and visualization, we used R programming and pertinent packages like ggplot2, plotly and lubridate. To make the Flights dataset easier to understand, we converted the departure and arrival timings into the HH:MM format. We also modified the graphs to show the distribution of airtime and the average delay by month. In a similar vein, we recreated graphs for the Spotify dataset in order to show the top 10 genres and the popularity value dispersion. Iterative improvement ensured the visualizations’ efficiency and clarity throughout the process.\nWe were able to learn more about the distribution of airtime among flights and seasonal fluctuations in delays by analyzing the Flights dataset. We effectively communicated these patterns using new graphics, making it possible for to quickly understand the results. In a similar vein, our investigation of the Spotify dataset revealed information about song popularity and the frequency of various musical genres\nWe were able to improve readability and clarity, two issues with the previous visualizations, by revamping the graphs. We enhanced the graphs’ readability and aesthetic appeal by modernizing the way time data was represented and honing the graphical display of important parameters. The significance of proficient data visualization in deriving meaningful conclusions from intricate datasets is emphasized by our project.\nIn conclusion, our mid project STAT 515 project has shown how powerful R programming can be when it comes to creating new statistical graphs for the Flights and Spotify datasets. We improved the graphs’ readability and clarity by modernizing the way time data was represented and enhancing the way important metrics were visualized. This allowed us to get a better understanding of the visualizations. In the future, we hope to investigate more sophisticated visualization methods in order to gain even more profound understanding of intricate datasets.\n#References: -\n#Dataset of Flights:-\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/code/saeedehkamjoo/visualization-on-flights-dataset/notebook\n#Dataset of spotify:-\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/code/ericbiernacki/popular-songs-bad-graph-example/notebook"
